                <h3>Soil</h3>

                <p>A good substract must have:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Good water retention: The soil needs to be able to hold and retain a sufficient amount of water to provide the Bonsai with moisture between each watering.</li><br>
                    <li>Good drainage: The soil should have the ability to immediately drain excess water out of the pot. Soils that lack good drainage are very water-retaining, lack aeration and are subject to an accumulation of salts. Retaining too much water will also cause the roots to rot, killing the tree.</li><br>
                    <li>Good aeration: The particles used in a Bonsai soil mix must be of sufficient size to allow small gaps or air pockets to form between each particle. In addition to the need for oxygen for the roots, it is also important to allow the good bacteria and intact mycorrhiza to occur, so that food processing will take place before it is taken up by the hair roots and sent to the leaves for photosynthesis.</li>

            <h3>Selection of the soil</h3>

            <p>
                There are several types of substrates for bonsai. Knowing its characteristics is very important, as it is the only way to make the plant grow healthy. So, let's see what are the different types of soil that we can use for our little tree:</p>
            <br>


            <h4>Akadama</h4>
            
            <p>
                Akadama is the quintessential bonsai substrate. It is a granular clay that comes from Japanese volcanoes. It is very interesting as it absorbs moisture and compost or fertilizer quickly, but at the same time allows air to circulate normally between your grains.<br>

                In addition, it has the advantage of knowing very well when it is dry and when it is wet, because when watering it acquires a much darker brown tone that contrasts with the creamy brown when it is dry. The pH is between 6.5 and 6.9, so it is ideal for elms, olive trees, ficus, ... even Japanese maples. It can be used alone or mixed with other substrates.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3wYvQnu" target="_blank">This one</a> is a great example of akadama soil.</p>
            <iframe sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-modals allow-forms allow-same-origin" style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=FR&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=bonsaitopia-21&language=fr_FR&marketplace=amazon&region=FR&placement=B00OVUWR6U&asins=B00OVUWR6U&linkId=57965a94c9132a8ff3b2794206c42668&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>
            <br>

            <h4>Kanuma</h4>

            <p>
                Kanuma is a clay, also granular, that comes from Japan. It has very similar characteristics to Akadama, but it is lighter and also has a lower pH (6.0).
                <br>
                It lacks nutrients, although on the other hand it must be said that it retains water and fertilizer without problems. For these reasons, it is an ideal substrate for acidic plants such as azaleas, gardenias, etc., as long as it is mixed with akadama.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Peat moss</h4>

            <p>
                Peat is by far the most used type of growing medium. They are decaying plant materials, and their characteristics are very interesting, as they retain moisture, drain water well and quickly, and promote rooting by being porous.

            <br>

            <h4>Prepared soil</h4>

            <p>
                With »prepared substrates» we mean those from different brands that are ready to use. They consist of two or more types of substrates mixed in different proportions that retain moisture, provide good aeration to the roots and ensure proper drainage.
                <br>
                They are usually sold in 5 liter bags at very cheap prices.
